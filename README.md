## Getting Started

Logic Gates Simulator is a program simulating logic circuits.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `gates` : the folder to contain the basic gates (AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, INVERTER)
- `circuits` : the folder that contains the prebuilt MUX 4 to 1 as of now.
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).
